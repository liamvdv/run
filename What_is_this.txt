Hey User, you might be surprised that you have a new directory! That's fine,
don't worry. 
You installed 'run' (github.com/liamvdv/run). It's the commandline tool that
easily allows you to to run your scripts.
In this directory, you will see a directory called "unix" or "windows", 
depending on your operating system (the author of this software is fully aware
that you are most likely running darwin or linux, yet he decided to use "unix" 
as a way to refer to equivalent shells).

The author cannot think of anything more you'd like to know, besides how to use 
'run'. As a result, he decided to include a short help manual in this file, 
in case you forgot it after installing 'run'.

'run' runs from the command promt, which will be represented with a dollar sign
($) in the following. Do not type it.

First, initialise 'run'. Because you can see this file, you can probably skip 
this. If any error occurs that reports a missing directory or file, try re-
initialising 'run'.
$ run -init

Now you will see your platform specific folder, right next to this file.
To add a shell script, just place it into that folder.
// TODO explain how to add scripts and so own...
